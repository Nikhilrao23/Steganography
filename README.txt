Steganography is the art of hiding the fact that communication is taking place, by hiding information in other information. Many different carrier file formats can be used, but digital images are the most popular because of their frequency on the internet. For hiding secret information in images, there exists a large variety of steganography techniques some are more complex than others and all of them have respective strong and weak points. Different applications may require absolute invisibility of the secret information, while others require a large secret message to be hidden. This project report intends to give an overview of image steganography, its uses and techniques. It also attempts to identify the requirements of a good steganography algorithm and briefly reflects on which steganographic techniques are more suitable for which applications.


INTRODUCTION

One of the reasons that intruders can be successful is the most of the information they acquire from a system is in a form that they can read and comprehend. Intruders may reveal the information to others, modify it to misrepresent an individual or organization, or use it to launch an attack. One solution to this problem is, through the use of steganography. Steganography is a technique of hiding information in digital media. In contrast to cryptography, it is not to keep others from knowing the hidden information but it is to keep others from thinking that the information even exists.
Steganography become more important as more people join the cyberspace revolution.  Steganography is the art of concealing information in ways that prevents the detection of hidden messages. Stegranography include an array of secret communication methods that hide the message from being seen or discovered.
Due to advances in ICT, most of information is kept electronically. Consequently, the security of information has become a fundamental issue. Besides cryptography, streganography can be employed to secure information. In cryptography, the message or encrypted message is embedded in a digital host before passing it through the network, thus the existence of the message is unknown. Besides hiding data for confidentiality, this approach of information hiding can be extended to copyright protection for digital media: audio, video and images.
The growing possibilities of modern communications need the special means of security especially on computer network. The network security is becoming more important as the number of data being exchanged on the internet increases.  Therefore, the confidentiality and data integrity  are requires to protect against unauthorized access and use. This has resulted in an explosive growth of the field of information hiding
Information hiding is an emerging research area, which encompasses applications such as copyright protection for digital media, watermarking, fingerprinting, and steganography.
	In watermarking applications, the message contains information such as owner identification and a digital time stamp, which usually applied for copyright protection.
	Fingerprint, the owner of the data set embeds a serial number that uniquely identifies the user of the data set. This adds to copyright information to makes it possible to trace any unauthorized used of the data set back to the user.
	Steganography hide the secrete message within the host data set and presence imperceptible and is to be reliably communicated to a receiver. The host data set is purposely corrupted, but in a covert way, designed to be invisible to an information analysis.


Software Requirements:
•	.NET Framework 3.5

Hardware Requirements:
Processor: Preferably 1.0 GHz or Greater.
RAM      : 512 MB or Greater.


Problem Statement:
The former consists of linguistic or language forms of hidden writing. The later, such as invisible ink, try of hide messages physically. One disadvantage of linguistic steganography is that users must equip themselves to have a good knowledge of linguistry. In recent years, everything is trending toward digitization. And with the development of the internet technology, digital media can be transmitted conveniently over the network. Therefore, messages can be secretly carried by digital media by using the steganography techniques, and then be transmitted through the internet rapidly
Steganography is the art of hiding the fact that communication is taking place, by hiding information in other information. Many different carrier file formats can be used, but digital images are the most popular because of their frequency on the internet. For hiding secret information in images, there exists a large variety of steganography techniques some are more complex than others and all of them have respective strong and weak points.
So we prepare this application, to make the information hiding more simple and user friendly.
